**Predicting Employee Attrition Using IBM Dataset**

Employee attrition, defined as the reduction in the workforce due to employees leaving the company through resignation or other reasons, is a critical issue for many organizations, affecting productivity, morale, and financial performance. Understanding the factors that contribute to employee turnover can help companies take proactive measures to retain talent and improve overall workplace satisfaction.

**The objective:** Develop a machine learning model capable of predicting when an employee is likely to resign.

Our solution involves using data analytics and machine learning to predict which employee is likely to resign and predict the moment when this employee will leave the company. By analyzing various factors such as job satisfaction, monthly income, age, and other relevant data, we can identify patterns and trends that indicate a higher likelihood of attrition.

**Approach:**
1.   Data Collection
2.   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3.   Data Preprocessing
4.   Feature Engineering
5.   Model Development
6.   Model Evaluation
7.   Prediction and Interpretation
8.   Implementation

**Expected Outcomes:**
*   A reliable machine learning model that accurately predicts employee attrition.
*   Identification of key factors contributing to employee turnover.
*   Proactive strategies and interventions to retain high-risk employees.
*   Improved employee satisfaction and reduced turnover rates.
